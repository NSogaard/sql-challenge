# Module #9 Challenge 
## Consulted Code Sources
- I followed the following tutorial (https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-date-functions/postgresql-extract/) in order to learn how to access the year from a piece of data of type Date in SQL. I marked where this code was used in the `query_file.sql` file where it was used
    - The only part of my code that used this tutorial as a source was the `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM emp.hire_date)` in query #2
I consulted an AskBCS Learning Assistant to look over my code so that I could confirm that I was doing what I was supposed to. I did this because I was unsure exactly what some of the requirements meant and wanted some clarification.

## Required File Locations
1) The table schemata is located at `./sql_files/table_creation_file.sql`
2) The query file is located at `./sql_files/query_file.sql`
3) The image of my ERD is located at `./diagram_files/ERD_image.png`
    - This is located with the code that generated that image (see `./diagram_files/diagram-code.txt`)
4) The README is located here!
